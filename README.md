## Overview of the Election Audit
The purpose of this project was to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee named "Tom" in utilizing python programming language to automate the process of an election audit.  In order to perform the audit, a script was written in Visual Studio Code and a myriad of coding techniques were applied to extract the election data from a csv file, perform calculations to reveal pertinant election results for each candidate and county, and to store these pertinent results onto a separate text file.  Consequently, this text file allowed for a convenient display of the audit's results so that it may be suitable to share with the associated election committee.
